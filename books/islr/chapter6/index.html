<p>In the regression setting, the standard linear model</p>

<div>
$$
\tag{6.1}Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon
$$
</div>

<p>is commonly used to  describe the relationship between a response $Y$ and a set of variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$. We have seen in Chapter 3 that one typiclaly fits this model using least square.</p>

<p>In the chapters that follow, we consider some approaches for extending the linear model framework. In chapter 7 we generalize (6.1) in order to accommodate non-linear, but still additive, relationships, while in Chapter 8 we consider even more general non-linear models. However, the linear model has distinct advantages in terms of inference and , on real-world problems, is oftern surprisingly competetive in relation to non-linear methods.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discuss some ways in which the simple linear model can be improved, by replacing plain least squares fitting with some alternative fitting procedures.</p>

<p>Why might we want to use another fitting procedure instead of least squares? As we will see, alternative fitting procedures can yield better prediction accuracy and model interpretability.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prediction accuracy: Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is approximately linear, the least squares estimates will have low bais. If $n \gg p$, that is if $n$, the number of observations, is much larger than $p$, the number of variables, then the least squares estimates tend to also have low variance, and hence will perform well on test observations. However, if $n$ is not much larger than $p$, then tere can be a lot of variability in the least squares fit, resulting in overfitting and consequently poor predictions on future observationss not used in the model training. And if $p &gt; n$, then there is no longer a unique least saures coefficient estimate: the variance if infinite so the method cannot be used at all. By <code>constraining</code> or <code>shrinking</code> the estiamted coefficients, we can oftern substantially reduce the variance at the cost of negligible increase in bias. This can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy with which we can predict the response for observations not used in the model training.</p></li>

<li><p>Model Interpretability: It is often the case that some or many of the variables used in a multiple regression model are in fact not associated with the response. Including such <code>irrelavant</code> variables leads to unnecessary complexity in the resulting model. By removing these variables&ndash;that is, by setting the corresponding coefficient estimates to zero&ndash;we can obtain a model that is more easily interpreted. Now least squares i extremely unlikely to yield any coefficient estimates that are exactly zero. In this chapter, we see some approaches for automatically performing <code>feature selection</code> or <code>variable selection</code>&ndash; that is, for excluding irrelevant variables from a multiple regression model.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many alternatives, both classical and modern, to using least squares to fit (6.1). In this chapter, we discuss three important classes of methods.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Subset Selection. This approach involves identifying a subset of the $p$ predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We then fit a model using least squares on the reduced set of variables.</p></li>

<li><p>Shrinkage. This appraoch involves fitting a model involving all $p$ predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relatively to the least squares estimates. This shrinkage, also know as <code>regularization</code>, has the effect of reducing variance. Depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be estimated to be exactly zero. Hence, shrinkage methods can also perform variable selection.</p></li>

<li><p>Dimension Reduction. This approach involves projecting the $p$ predictions into a M-dimentional subspace, where $M &lt; p$. This is achieved by computing $M$ different <code>linear combinations</code>, or <code>projections</code>, of the variables. Then these $M$ projections are used as predictors to fit a linear regression model by least squares.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="subset-selection">Subset Selection</h2>

<p>Methods include best subset and stepwise model selection procedures.</p>

<h3 id="best-subset-selection">Best Subset Selection</h3>

<p>To perform <code>best subset selection</code>, we fit a separate least squares regression for each possible combination of the $p$ predictors. That is, we fit all $p$ models that contain exactly one predictors, all $\big(_2^p\big) = p(p-1)/2$ models that contain exactly two predictors, and so forth. We then look at all the resulting models, with the goal of identifying the one that is best.</p>

<p>This problem of selecting the best model among the $2^p$ possibilities considered by best subset selection is not trivial.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Algorithm 6.1 Best subset selection</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Let $\Mu_0$ denote the null model, which contains no predictions. This model simply predicts the sample mean for each observaton.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2. For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, p$: <li>(a) Fit all $\big(_k^p\big)$ models that contain exactly $k$ predictors; <li>(b) Pick the best among these $\big(_k^p\big)$ models, and call it $\Mu_k$. Here best is defined as having the smallest RSS, or equivalently largest $R^2$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3. Select a single best model from among $\Mu_0,\ldots,\Mu_p$ using corss-validated prediction error, $C_p(AIC)$, $BIC$, or adjusted $R^2$.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In Algorithm 6.1, Step 2 identifies the best model for each subset size, in order to reduce the problem from one of $2^p$ possible models to one of $p+1$ possible models.</p>

<p>Now in order to select a single a single best model, we must simply choose among the $p+1$ options. This task must be performed with care, because the RSS of these models decreases monotonically, and the $R^2$ increases monotonically, as the number of features included in the models increases. If we use these statistics to select the best model, then we will always end up with a model involving all of the variables. The problem is that a low RSS or high $R^2$ indicates a model with low <em>training</em> error, whereas we wish to choose a model that has a low <em>test</em> error. Therefore, in Step 3, we use corss-validated prediction error, $C_p$, BIC, or adjusted $R^2$ in order to seelct among $\Mu_0, \Mu_1, \ldots, \Mu_p$.</p>

<p>Although we have presented best subset selection here for least squares regression, the same ideas apply to other types of models, such as logistic regression. In the case of logistic regression, instead of ordering models by RSS in Step 2 of Algorithm 6.1, we instead use the <code>deviance</code>, a measure that plays the role of RSS for a broader class of models. The deviance, is negative two times the maximized log-likelihood; the smaller the deviance, the better the fit.</p>

<p>While best subset selection is a simple and conceptually appealing approach, it suffers fro computational limitations. Consuquently, best subset selection become cmoputationally infeasible for values of $p$ greater than 40, even with extremely fast modern computers.</p>

<h3 id="stepwise-selection">Stepwise Selection</h3>

<p>For computational reasons, best subset selection cannot be applied with very large $p$. Best subset selection may also suffer from statistical problems when $p$ is large: overfitting and high variance of the coefficient estimates.</p>

<p>For both of these reasons, <code>stepwise</code> method, which explore a far more restricted set of models, are attractive alternatives to best subset selection.</p>

<h4 id="forward-stepwise-selection">Forward Stepwise Selection</h4>

<p>Forward stepwise selection begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model, one-at-a-time, until all of the predictors are in the model. In particular, at each step the variable that gives the greatest additional improvement to the fit is added to the model. More formally, the forward stepwise selection procedure is given in Algorithm 6.2.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Algorithm 6.2 Forward stepwise selection</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Let $\Mu_0$ denote the null model, which contains no predictors</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2. For $k=1,2,\ldots,p-1$:<li>(a) Consider all $p-k$ models that augment the predictors in $\Mu_k$ with one additional predictor. <li>(b) Choose the best among these $p-k$ models, and call it $\Mu_k+1$. Here best is defined as having smallest RSS or highest $R^2$.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3. Select a single best model from among $\Mu_0,\ldots,\Mu_p$ using cross-validated prediction error, $C_p (AIC)$, BIC, or adjusted $R^2$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In Step 2(b) of Algorithm 6.2, we must identify the best model from among those $p-k$ that augment $\Mu_k$ with one additional predictor. We can do this by simply choosing the model with the lowest RSS or the highest $R^2$. However, in Step 3, we must identify the best model among a set of models with different number of variables. This is more challenging.</p>

<p>Forward stepwise selection&rsquo;s computational advantage over best subset selection is clear. Though forward stepwise tend to do well in practice, it is not guaranteed to find the best possible model out of all $2^p$ models. For instance, suppose that in a given data set with $p=3$ predictors, the best possible one-variable  model contains $X_1$, and the best possible two-variable model instead contains $X_2$ and $X_3$. Then forward stepwise selection will fail to select the best possible two-variable model, because $Mu_1$ will contain $X_1$, so $\Mu_2$ must also contain $X_1$ together with one additional variable.</p>

<p>Forward stepwise selection can be applied even in the high-dimensional setting where $n&lt;p$; however, in this case, it is possible to construct submodels $\Mu_0,\ldots,\Mu_n-1$ only, since each submodel is fit using least squares, which wil not yield a unique solution if $p \ge n$.</p>

<p>Backward stepwise selection begins with the full least square model containing all $p$ predictors, and then iteratively removes teh least useful predictor, one-at-a-time.</p>

<p>Like forward stepwise selection, the backward selection approach searches through only $1+p(p+1)/2$ models, and so can be applied in settings where $p$ is too large to apply best subset selection. Also like forward selection, backward selection is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to yield the best model containing a subset of the $p$ predictors.</p>

<p>Backward selection requires that the number of samples $n$ is larger than the number of variables $p$ (so that the full model can be fit). In contrast, forward stepwise can be used even when $n &lt; p$, and so is the ony viable subset method when $p$ is very large.</p>

<h4 id="hybrid-approaches">Hybrid Approaches</h4>

<p>The best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection approaches generally give similar but not identical models. As an alternative, hybrid versions of forward and backward stepwise selection are available, in which variables are added to the model sequentially, in analogy to forward selection. However, after adding each new variable, the method may also remove any variables that no longer provide an improvement in the model fit. Such an approach attempts to more closely mimic best subset selection while retaining the computational advantages of forward and backward stepwise selection.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-optimal-model">Choosing the Optimal Model</h3>

<p>Best subset, forward and backward selection result in the creation of a set of models, each of which contains a subset of the $p$ predictors. In order to implement these methods, we need a way to determine which of these models is best. As we disscussed earlier, the model containing all of the predictors will always have the smallest $RSS$ and the largest $R^2$, since these these quantities are related to the training error. Instead, we wish to choose a model with a low test error. As we know, the training error can be a poor estimate of test error. Therefore, $RSS$ and $R^2$ are not suitable for selecting the best model among a collection of models with different numbers of predictors.</p>

<p>In order to select the best model with respect to test error, we need to estimate the test error. There are two common approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We can indirectly estiamte test error by making an adjustment to the training error to account for the bias due to overfitting.</p></li>

<li><p>We can directly estiamte the test error, using either a validation set approach or a cross-validation approach.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<h4 id="c-p-aic-bic-and-adjusted-r-2">$C_p, AIC, BIC$, and Adjusted $R^2$</h4>

<p>Training set $RSS$ and training set $R^2$ cannot be used to select from among a set of models with different numbers of variables. However, a number of techniques for adjusting the training error for the model size are available. These approaches can be used to select among a set of models with different numbers of variables. We now consider four such approaches: $C_p$, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and adjusted $R^2$.</p>

<p>For a fitted least squares model containig $d$ predictors, the $C_p$ estimate of test MSE is computed using the equation</p>

<div>
$$
\tag{6.2}C_p = \frac{1}{n}(RSS+2d\hat{\sigma}^2)
$$
</div>

<p>where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is an estimate of the variance of the error $\epsilon$ associated with each response measurement in (6.1). Essentially, the $C_p$ statistic adds a penalty of $2d\hat{\sigma}^2$ to the training $RSS$ in order to adjust for the fact that the training error tends to underestimate the test error. Clearly, the penalty increases as the number of predictors in the model increases; this is intended to adjust for the corresponding decrease in training $RSS$.</p>

<p>The AIC criterion is defined for a large class of models fit by maximum likelihood. In the case of the model (6.1) with Gaussian errors, maximum likelihood and least squares are the same thing. In this case AIC is given by</p>

<div>
$$
AIC = \frac{1}{n\hat{\sigma}^2}(RSS+2d\hat{\sigma}^2)
$$
</div>

<p>where, for simplicity, we have omitted an additive constant. Hence for least squares models, $C_p$ and $AIC$ are proportional to each other.</p>

<p>BIC is derived froma Bayesian point of view, but ends up looking similar to $C_p$ and AIC. For the least squares model with $d$ predictors, the BIC is, up to irrelevant constants, given by</p>

<div>
$$
BIC = \frac{1}{n}(RSS+log(n)d\hat{\sigma}^2)
$$
</div>

<p>Like $C_p$, the BIC will tend to take on a small value for a model with a low test error, and so generally we select the model that has the lowest BIC value. Notice that BIC replaces the $2d\hat{\sigma}^2$ used by $C_p$ with a $log(n)d\hat{\sigma}^2$ term, where $n$ is the number of observations. Since $log(n) &gt; 2$ for any $n &gt; 7$, the BIC generally places a heavier penalty on models with many variables, and hence results in the selection of smaller models than $C_p$.</p>

<p>The adjusted $R^2$ statistic is another popular approach for selecting among a set of models that contain different numbers of variables. Recall from  Chapter 3 that the usual $R^2$ is defined as $1 - RSS/TSS$, where$TSS - \sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2$ is the total sum of squares for the response. Since RSS always decreases as more variables are added, the $R^2$ always increases as more variables are added.</p>

<p>For a least squares model with $d$ variables, the adjusted $R^2$ statistic is calcualted as</p>

<div>
$$
Adjusted R^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS/(n-d-1)}{TSS/(n-1)}
$$
</div>

<p>Unlike $C_p$, $AIC$, and $BIC$, for which a small value indicates a model with a low test error, a large value of $adjusted \ R^2$ indicates a model with a small test error. Maximizing the $adjusted \ R^2$ is equivalent to minimizing $\frac{RSS}{n-d-1}$. While $RSS$ always decreases as the number of variables in the model increases, $\frac{RSS}{n-d-1}$ may increase or decrease, due to the  presence of $d$ in the denominator.</p>

<p>$C_p$, $AIC$, and $BIC$ all have rigorous theoretical justifications. These justificatons rely on asymptotic arguments (scenarios where the sample size $n$ is very large). Despite its popularity, and even though it is quier intuitive, the adjusted $R^2$ is not as well motivated in statistical theory as $AIC$, $BIC$ and $C_p$. Here we have presented the formulas for $AIC$, $BIC$, and $C_p$ in the case of a linear model fit using least squares; however, these quantities can also be defined for more general types of models.</p>

<h4 id="validation-and-cross-validation">Validation and Cross-validation</h4>

<p>As an alternative to the approaches just discussed, we can directly estimate the test error using the validation set and cross-validatoin methods. We can compute the validatoin set error or the cross-validation error for each model under consideration, and then select the model for which the resulting estiamted test error is smallest. This procedure has an adavantage realative to $AIC$, $BIC$, $C_p$ and adjusted $R^2$, in that it provides a direct estimate of the test error, and makes fewer assumptions about the true underlying model. It can also be used in a wider range of model selection tasks, even in cases where it is hard to pinpoint the model degree of freedom or hard to estimate the error varaince $\sigma^2$.</p>

<h2 id="shrinkage-methods">Shrinkage Methods</h2>

<p>The subset selection methods described in Section 6.1 involve using least squares to fit a linear model that containts a subset of the predictors. As an alternative, we can fit a model containing all $p$ predictors using a technique that constrains or regularizes the coefficient estimates, or equivalently, that shrinks the coefficient estimates toward zero. It may not be immediately obvious why such a constraint should improve the fit, but it turns out that shrinking the coefficient estimates can significantly reduce their variance.</p>

<p>The two best-known techniques for shrinking the regression coefficients towards zero are <code>ridge regression</code> and the <code>lasso</code>.</p>

<h3 id="ridge-regression">Ridge Regression</h3>

<p>Recall from Chapter 3 that the least squares fitting procedure estimates $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots,\beta_p$ using the values that minimize</p>

<div>
$$
RSS=\sum_{i=1}^n \Big(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j x_{ij}\Big)^2
$$
</div>

<p><code>Ridge regression</code> is very similar to least squares, except that the coefficients are estimated by minimizing a slightly different quantity. In particular, the ridge regression coefficient estimates $\hat{\beta}^R$ are the values that minimize</p>

<div>
$$
\tag{6.5}\sum_{i=1}^n\Big(y_i-\beta_0-\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j x_{ij}\Big)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2 = RSS + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2
$$
</div>

<p>where $\lambda \ge 0$ is a <em>tuning parameter</em>, to be determined separately. Equation 6.5 trades off two different criteria. As with least squares, ridge regression seeks coefficient estimates that fit the data well, by making the RSS small. However, the second term, $\lambda\Sigma_j\beta_j^2$, called a <code>shrinkage penalty</code>, is small when $\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p$ are close to zero, and so it has the effect of shrinking the estimates of $\beta_j$ towards zero.</p>

<p>The tuning parameter $\lambda$ serves to control the relative impact of these two terms on the regression coefficient estimates. When $\lambda = 0$, the penalty term has no effect, and ridge regression will produce the least squares estimates. However, as $\lambda \rarr \inf$, the impact of the shrinkage penalty grows, and the ridge regression coefficient estimates will approach zero.</p>

<p>Unlike least squares, which generates only one set of coefficient estimates, ridge regression will produce a different set of coefficient estimates $\hat{\beta}_{\lambda}^R$, for each value of $\lambda$. Selecting a good value of $\lambda$ is critical.</p>

<p>Note that in (6.5), the shrinkage penalty is applied to $\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p$, but not to the intercept $\beta_0$. We want to shrink the estiamted association of each variable with the response; however, we do not want to shrink the intercept, which is simply a measure of the mean value of the response.</p>

<p>The standard least squares coefficient estimates are scale equivariant: multiplying $X_j$ by a constant $c$ simply leads to a scaling of the least squares coefficient estimates by a factor of $1/c$. In other words, regardless of how the $j$th predictor is scaled, $X_j \hat{\beta}_j$ will remain the same. In contrast, the ridge regression coefficient estiamtes can change substantially when multiplying a given predictor by a constant. Therefore, it is best to apply ridge regression after <code>standardizing the predictors</code>, using the formula</p>

<div>
$$
\tag{6.6}\tilde{x}_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{ij}-\bar{x}_j)^2}}
$$
</div>

<p>so that they are all on the same scale. In (6.6), the denominator is the estimated standard deviation of the $j$th predictor. Consequently, all of the standardized predictors will have a standard deviation of one.</p>

<h4 id="why-does-ridge-regression-improve-over-least-squares">Why Does Ridge Regression Improve Over Least Squares</h4>

<p>Ridge regression&rsquo;s advantage over least squares is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As $\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias. At the least squres coefficient estimates, which correspond to ridge regression with $\lambda = 0$, the variance is high but there is no bias. But as $\lambda$ increases, the shrinkage of the ridge coefficient estimates leads to a substantial reduction in the variance of the predictions, at the expense of a slight indrease in bias.</p>

<p>In general, in situations where the relationship between the response and the predictors is close to linear, the least squres estimates will have low bias but may have high variance. This means that a small change in the training data can cause a large change in the least squares coefficient estimates. In particular, when the number of variables $p$ is almost as large as the number of observations $n$. And if $p &gt; n$, then the least squares estimates do not even have a unique solution, whereas ridge regression can still preform well by trading off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. Hence, ridge regression works best in situations where the least squares estimates have high variance.</p>

<p>Ridge regression also have substantial computational advantages over best subset selection, which requires searching through $2^p$ models. As we discussed previously, even for moderate values of $p$, such a search can be computationally infeasible. In contrast, for any fixed value of $\lambda$, ridge regression only fits a single model, and the model-fitting procedure can be performed quite quickly.</p>

<h3 id="the-lasso">The Lasso</h3>

<p>Ridge regression does have one obvious disadvantages. Unlike best subset, foreward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection, which will generally select models that involve just a subset of the variables, ridge regression will include all $p$ predictors in the final model. The penalty $\lambda\Sigma\beta_j^2$ in (6.5) will shrink all of the coefficients toward zero, but it will not set any of them exactly to zero (unless $\lambda = \inf$). This may not be a problem for prediction accuracy, but it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings in which the number of varaible $p$ is quite large.</p>

<p>The <code>lasso</code> is a relatively recent alternative to ridge regression that overcomes this disadvantage. The lasso coefficients, $\hat{\beta}_\lambda^L$, minimize the quantity</p>

<div>
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n\bigg(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_i x_{ij} \bigg)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p|\beta_j| = RSS + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p|\beta_j|
$$
