      <description>Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information abou the fitted model. For example, in order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which the resulting fits differ.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting qualitative responses, a process that is known as classification. Predicting a qualitative response for an obervation can be refered to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first predict the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification.</description>

      <description>Linear Regression Linear regression is a very simple supervised learning methods, though still very useful.
Simple Linear Regression Simple linear regression is a straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor variable $X$. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.
 $$ Y \approx \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X $$  In the equation, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are two unknown constants that represetn the intercept and slope termes in the linear model.</description>

      <description>Statistical Learning What is statistial learning Suppose we observe a quantitative response $Y$ and $p$ different predictors, $X_1, X_2, \ldots,X_p$ . We assume that there is a relationship between $Y$ and $X=(X_1, X_2,\ldots,X_p)$, which can be written as
 $$ Y=f(X)+\epsilon $$  Here $f$ is some fixed but unknown fucntion of $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_p$, and $\epsilon$ is a random error term, which is independent of $X$ and has mean zero. In this formulation, $f$ represents the systematic informationa $X$ provides about $Y$.</description>

      <description>An overview of statistial learning Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.
Two categories: supervised and unsupervised.
Supervised: Build models based on known input and output data, then use the model for prediction or estimation.
Unsupervised: There are inputs but no supervised outputs. We can learn relationships and structures from such data.
Notation and simple algebra Let the $X$ denotes a matrix. $X_{ij}$ represents the value of row $i$ and column $j$.</description>
